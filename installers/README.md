# Installers

To use one of these, include the name of the name of the file (minus the .sh extension)
in the INSTALLERS array prior to sourcing [install.sh](https://github.com/svrana/bash-home-scaffold/tree/master/install.sh)
from [bash-home-scaffold](https://github.com/svrana/bash-home-scaffold).

If you have a plugin of the same name its installer will be run automatically if one exists.

bash-home-scaffold assumes that the installer will live in an installers/ directory under your
$DOTFILES directory.
