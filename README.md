# dotfiles

These dotfiles use the [bash-home-scaffold](https://github.com/svrana/bash-home-scaffold) to link configuration files, create directories, install packages and to break functionality into [plugins](https://github.com/svrana/dotfiles/tree/master/plugins) and [installers](https://github.com/svrana/dotfiles/tree/master/installers).

## Getting Started

```
bash < (curl -L https://dotfiles.vranix.com/bootstrap)
```

By default this will clone this repo into ~/.dotfiles and the bash-home-scaffold repo into ~/Projects/bash-home-scaffold. To customize, take a look at the [bootstrap](https://github.com/svrana/dotfiles/tree/master/bootstrap) code.
